Interval fracture of the right interlaminar screw and increased lucency surrounding the left laminar screw. These findings raise concern for abnormal motion at the C2 fusion site.,"There is redemonstration of C2 -occipital fusion. As seen previously, this fusion is accomplished through a plate and screw device anchored to the occipital protuberance with fusion rods extending to crossing laminar screws at C2. Since the prior examination, there has been fracture of the right interlaminar screw (series 3 image 38). There is also increased lucency surrounding the left laminar screw (series 80265 image 30).

The procedure, risks including bleeding, mistargeting and infection, and benefits of needle-wire localization were discussed with the patient. Questions were answered. Consent was obtained both verbally and in writing. The time out form was completed to confirm patient identity and site of procedure. The left breast was placed in an alphanumeric grid using superior to inferior approach. When the target was positioned in the aperture of the grid, the skin was cleansed with chlorhexidine. Local anesthesia was obtained using 2% Lidocaine. Using coordinates from the grid, a 9 cm Kopans needle was placed through the lesion. On orthogonal mammography, adequate positioning of the needle was confirmed after adjusting depth so the needle tip was approximately 2cm deep to the center of the target. A spring wire was then deployed. Repeat two view orthogonal mammograms reveal the spring wire to be in excellent position. The mammogram was annotated and reviewed with Dr. Jaskowiak prior to the patient's procedure. Patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the holding area in stable condition. Dr. Kulkarni performed the procedure and was present during the procedure at all times.Orthogonal digital specimen radiographs revealed the mass, multiple small clusters of calcifications, clip and spring wire to be within the specimen.

The lesion to be targeted is a hypoechoic mass measuring 2.4 x 1.9 x 2.4 cm at the 11 o’clock position with increased vascularity, 7 cm from the nipple. The lesion was readily visible.PROCEDURE: The procedure and its risks, including bleeding, infection, and failure to diagnose, and expected benefits of ultrasound-guided core biopsy with possible percutaneous placement of a marking clip and post-procedure unilateral mammogram were discussed with the patient. Questions were answered. Consent was obtained both verbally and in writing. The time-out form was completed to confirm patient identity and side/type of procedure.The left breast was cleansed with chlorhexidine over the target area. Transducer was sterilely sheathed. Local anesthesia was obtained using 2% lidocaine superficially, with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine at depth. A 3 mm incision was made in the skin with a #11 scalpel blade. Using aseptic technique, continuous ultrasound guidance and a lateromedial approach, five 12-gauge core needle (Celero) specimens were obtained of the lesion. Targeting was judged very good. All specimens were placed in a petri dish with a small amount of saline. Specimen quality was judged very good.Nana Owusu (pager 6140) picked up the specimen. Pressure was held over the biopsy site until all bleeding subsided. The skin incision was closed with a Steri-Strip.

"In the left mandible, there is redemonstration of a lytic area extending from the buccal cortex into the substance of the body of the mandible. There has been further extension of the lesion into the lingual","In the left mandible, there is redemonstration of a lytic area extending from the buccal cortex into the substance of the body of the mandible. Since the prior examination of July 2011, there has been extraction of the left lower second premolar as well as the fragments of the remaining left lower molars seen previously. There has been further extension of the lesion into the lingual cortex of the mandible in this location. Also, the overall size of the lytic region measures 2.8 x 1.6 cm, increased relative to July and particularly June 2011 where the cavity measured 2.5 x 1.4 cm and 2.2 x 1.3 cm respectively. There is sclerosis of the mandible seen at the angle and the margins of the lytic lesion remain relatively well-preserved. Therefore, findings are compatible with radiation necrosis. However, the progressive nature of this lesion as well as the appearance of soft tissue within the lytic cavity raise the remote possibility of neoplastic infiltration. Suggest correlation with clinical exam.Elsewhere in the head and neck, there is redemonstration of treatment related changes including truncated appearance of the anterior tongue and stranding in the soft tissue planes of the suprahyoid neck, consistent with prior surgery and radiation. In this background, no recurrent neck mass or cervical lymphadenopathy can be identified. However, there are scattered small lymph nodes which lack aggressive features or size criteria for pathologic enlargement. The aerodigestive tract outside of the oral cavity is unremarkable. No new area of focal effacement or exophytic mass is identified. Submandibular glands are resected or atrophic.

There is redemonstration of a moderate chronic compression deformity involving L4 with evidence of interval vertebroplasty with central hypointense signal. It appears to be from a right unipedicular approach. Compared to the most recent exam from 11/6/2015, there is slight further progression of height loss, measuring 10 mm CC on 601/10, compared to previous 15 mm. There is now mild retropulsion of fracture fragments with mild-moderate narrowing of the central spinal canal at the mid L4 level. There is moderate left foraminal narrowing at L3-L4 and moderate-severe narrowing at L4-L5. On the right, there is only minimal foraminal stenosis at L4-L5. There is effacement of the left lateral recess at the L4 level.The extent of metastatic disease at the L4 level has significantly progressed, with now significant abnormal soft tissue enhancement extending along the left L4 pedicle which itself is difficult to delineate likely due to osseous destruction. The left facet joint is slightly widened with presence of enhancing soft tissue. There is a large paraspinal component of enhancing soft tissue extending posteriorly, with the presence of peripherally enhancing complex fluid collections. The largest of these measures up to 4.1 cm transverse x 4.5 cm AP x 6.6 cm CC. Multiple small peripherally enhancing collections are noted superior medial to this. The largest collection and some of the smaller collections demonstrate probable blood-fluid levels with minimal intrinsic T1 hyperintensity nondependently.

Questions were answered. Consent was obtained both verbally and in writing. The time out form was completed to confirm patient identity and site of procedure. The left breast was placed in an alphanumeric grid using lateral to medial approach. When the target was positioned in the aperture of the grid, the skin was cleansed with chlorhexidine. Local anesthesia was obtained using 2% Lidocaine. Using coordinates from the grid, a 7 cm Kopans needle was placed adjacent to the lesion. On orthogonal mammography, adequate positioning of the needle was confirmed after adjusting depth so the needle tip was approximately 2cm deep to the center of the target.
